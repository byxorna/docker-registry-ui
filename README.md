[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/6a4a2e14de08a4e0e359285300cf1965/s/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/6a4a2e14de08a4e0e359285300cf1965)

This project provides a web UI for [docker-registry](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-registry) ([library/registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/library/registry/) (>= 9.0)).

* This application is written in JavaScript, and you can deploy this application easily.
* This application doesn't store any user data.
* You can find the necessary information simply from the Docker Registry [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/registry_api/).


#### How to Use

- Prepare CORS supported docker-registry.

```
docker run -d -e CORS_ORIGINS=[\'*\'] registry
```

We have already deployed this web-ui to our [github pages](http://worksap-ate.github.io/docker-registry-ui/#/).

- Please set your docker-registry IP at "Set Registry IP" option. 
- And you can use the Web UI.

#### How to run with Docker

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 worksap-ate/docker-registry-ui
```

#### Trouble Shooting

    2. Check your CORS support settings
